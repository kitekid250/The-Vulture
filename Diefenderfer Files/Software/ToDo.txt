Easiest case:
	Only one motor and potentiometer
	No additional tasks
	Move until pot has reached threshold, simple controls
		Start moving motor in correct direction
		Check ADC for the motor until reaches correct position
		Stop Motor

Blinking LED Motor Case:
	Only one motor and potentiometer
	One additional task:
		Blink a LED in background
	Move until pot has reached threshold, simple controls
		Start moving motor in correct direction
		Check ADC and stop motor when it reaches the proper position

Blinking LED Stepper Case:
	Only one stepper and potentiometer
	One additional task:
		Blink a LED in background
	Motion controls: ?
	
	This one is much more complicated because the stepper motor
	must be constantly pulsed unlike the motors which operate 
	independantly

	Option A: The steppers moving might need to be the background task
	Option B: Otherwise they will need to move a few steps and stop to check
		the ADC.
	Option C: Calculate the number of steps needed to move the steppers to get to the
		desired position and step the motors.
	
Next:
	Make a backup!
	Move all code to a cpp file and add functions to set the motor positions per motor number
	Test to make sure I didn't hose anything
